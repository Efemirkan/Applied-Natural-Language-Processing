        "The performance of the **Naive Bayes classifier** was noticeably stronger than the performance of the **word list classifier**. This can be understood by looking at both the numerical results and the behaviour of the two models.\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Naive Bayes classifier** achieved higher **accuracy**. This means that a larger proportion of the test reviews was assigned the correct label. In contrast, the **word list classifier** reached only about sixty four percent accuracy, which indicates that many reviews were misclassified. The improvement can be explained mathematically because Naive Bayes uses the full likelihood of the document, which can be expressed as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
        "P(\\,d\\,|\\,c\\,) &=& P(\\,\\{w_1,\\ldots,w_n\\}\\,|\\,c\\,)\\\\\n",
        "&=& \\prod_{i=1}^n P(\\,w_i\\,|\\,c\\,)\n",
        "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where every word contributes to the overall decision. Since the entire distribution of words is used, more evidence is collected from each review.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Precision** was also higher for the **Naive Bayes classifier**. For the **word list classifier**, many reviews predicted as positive were actually negative. This pattern occurs because the **word list classifier** relies only on a fixed list of words and assigns a positive score whenever such words appear. If a negative review contains a few words typically associated with positive sentiment, the classifier is easily misled. **Naive Bayes classifier** reduces this problem because the probability of all observed words is considered. A single misleading word receives less influence when many other words provide contradictory evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recall** was very high for both models, but the underlying reasons differ. The **word list classifier** reached extremely high recall because it almost always produced a positive prediction. This behaviour inflates recall but does not represent balanced performance. **Naive Bayes** achieved similarly high recall while maintaining much better precision, which indicates that it successfully captured most positive reviews without heavily misclassifying negative ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The **F1 scores** further highlight this difference. Since **F1** is defined as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$F1 = \\frac{2(\\text{precision} \\times \\text{recall})}{\\text{precision} + \\text{recall}}$$\n",
        "\n",
        "a higher value indicates more balanced decision making. The **Naive Bayes classifier** achieved a noticeably higher **F1 score**, showing that it provided both reliable and complete detection of the positive class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The contrast between the two models can be understood by considering how each one represents textual information. In the **word list classifier**, only a small set of discriminative words is used, and all other vocabulary is effectively ignored. As a result, the representation of each review becomes very limited. If a review expresses sentiment using words that do not appear in these lists, that information is simply not captured, and the classifier cannot respond to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the **Naive Bayes classifier**, a probability distribution is learned for every word in the training data. During classification, evidence from all observed words is combined, which means that even weaker indicators of sentiment can contribute to the final decision. This produces a much richer and more flexible representation of each review, allowing finer distinctions in how sentiment is expressed to be reflected in the model’s predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the results show that the **word list classifier** is simple and interpretable but too restrictive. The **Naive Bayes classifier** benefits from its probabilistic model and from using the full set of features, which allows it to provide more accurate, more precise and more reliable sentiment predictions."

        "# Design Decisions\n",
        "The experiment was designed to investigate how the length of the wordlists impact the performance of the **SimpleClassifier**. The value of **k** was treated as the independent variable, and a range of list sizes was selected in order to examine both small and large wordlists. The values of **k** were chosen to cover a wide range, beginning with moderately short lists and increasing gradually to substantially larger ones. This made it possible to observe whether performance improves steadily, remains steady, or declines.\n",
        "\n",
        "The same training set and test set were used for every value of **k** so that the results would be comparable. All reviews were preprocessed in a consistent way before being converted into frequency distributions. For each value of **k**, a new **SimpleClassifier** instance was trained from the same data. This ensured that any differences in performance could be attributed to the size of the wordlists rather than to randomness in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment focused on **accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score** as evaluation measures, because these metrics capture different aspects of classifier behaviour. Once each classifier had been trained, its predictions on the test data were collected and a **confusion matrix** was constructed. The scores were then recorded and organised into a table. A line plot was produced to visualise how the performance changed as the wordlists grew larger. The plot made it easier to identify trends in the results and to interpret the relationship between k and classification quality."

        "# Discussion of conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "The results of the experiment show that the performance of the **SimpleClassifier** is sensitive to the length of the wordlists, although the relationship is not entirely linear. When the lists are relatively short, such as **k = 50**, the classifier achieves the lowest accuracy in the experiment. This suggests that a small number of discriminating words does not provide enough information to distinguish the sentiment of the reviews in a reliable way. As the value of **k** increases, the classifier begins to perform better, and this improvement is visible in both accuracy and F1 score. The increase between **k = 50** and **k = 150** is especially noticeable, and it indicates that adding more discriminative words gives the classifier access to a richer set of sentiment cues.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the results also show that the gains start to level off once the lists become moderately large. Between **k = 150** and **k = 300**, the changes in **accuracy** and **F1** score are minor, which suggests that the classifier is no longer gaining much additional benefit from extending the wordlists. Very large lists, such as **k = 1000**, do not produce a dramatic drop in performance, but they also do not lead to further improvement. This pattern indicates that the classifier begins to incorporate many words that contribute little to the final prediction. These words introduce noise and reduce the influence of the most informative terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "The highest accuracy was observed at **k = 500**, and the highest F1 score occurred at the same point. This suggests that there may be an optimal range where the wordlists are large enough to capture most of the sentiment vocabulary while still being selective enough to avoid excessive noise. The shape of the graph supports this interpretation, as performance rises steadily from **k = 50** to **k = 150**, stabilises around **k = 200**, and reaches a peak at **k = 500** before flattening out again.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the experiment indicates that the **word list classifier** benefits from longer lists up to a certain point, but that extremely large lists do not guarantee better performance. An intermediate value of **k** appears to offer the best balance between coverage and noise, which is typical for **simple bag-of-words models** that depend heavily on the discriminative power of individual tokens."

        "The results obtained in this study show that the **Naive Bayes classifier** performs better than the **wordlist classifier** across all evaluation measures. It produced higher accuracy and F1 scores, and it achieved more balanced precision and recall. This indicates that **Naive Bayes** is able to make use of a wider range of information in the reviews, whereas the wordlist classifier relies only on a limited set of discriminating words.\n",
        "\n",
        "The experiment on different values of **k** also showed that the **wordlist classifier** is highly sensitive to the size of the lists. Its performance changes noticeably when **k** is altered, and it can decline when the lists become too small or too large. In contrast, the **Naive Bayes model** remains stable because it works with the full distribution of tokens rather than depending on a small number of selected words.\n",
        "\n",
        "For these reasons, **Naive Bayes** would be recommended for future work. It is more robust, it generalises better to unseen data, and it requires fewer manual design decisions. The **wordlist classifier** is simple and interpretable, but the **Naive Bayes model** offers more reliable and consistent performance for sentiment classification."
